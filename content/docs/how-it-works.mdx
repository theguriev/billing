### 2. Issue Your Token
Once your wallet is set up, it’s time to [create your currency](/blls/create-token)! You’ll define the name, symbol, and initial issuance amount of your token. This initial batch of tokens is immediately transferred to your newly created wallet. No waiting, no hassle—your currency is live!
