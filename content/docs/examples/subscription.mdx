description: Subscription Token System (Under Development)

This example is still under development, but in fact, there is nothing complicated about it. The core idea is simple: store the private and public keys on the side of the service where you want to sell the subscription.

### How It Works

1. **Storing Keys**: The private and public keys are securely stored on your service’s side. This gives you full control over your tokens.
2. **Access to Tokens**: By storing these keys, you can write off tokens at any convenient time, such as when a subscription is activated or renewed.
3. **Subscription Management**: The process ensures that you can easily manage token-based subscriptions without worrying about complex setups.

### Why It’s Simple

The key idea here is that by controlling the private keys, you control the tokens. This makes it very easy to automate subscription processes, such as debiting tokens from a user’s wallet for a service.

### Status

While this system is still under development, we’re working to make it even more user-friendly and scalable. Stay tuned for updates!
