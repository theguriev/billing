description: How to Retrieve a Token by ID
---


To retrieve a specific token by its unique ID, you need to send a GET request to the following API endpoint:

```bash
[GET] api.blls.me/billing/tokens/:id
```

### Request Parameters

- **id**: The unique identifier of the token you want to retrieve.

#### Example Request:

To retrieve a token with ID `0x12345abcdef`, the request would look like this:

```bash
api.blls.me/billing/tokens/0x12345abcdef
```

### API Responses

#### Success Response:

If the request is successful, the server will return a `200` status code with the token details in JSON format.

```json
{
  "_id": "string",         // Unique token ID
  "name": "string",        // Token name
  "timestamp": "2024-10-15T18:42:40.120Z",  // Timestamp of token creation
  "address": "string",     // Wallet address that controls the token
  "symbol": "string"       // Token symbol
}
```

**This response includes:**

* **_id:** The unique identifier of the token.
* **name:** The name of the token.
* **timestamp:** The time the token was created.
* **address:** The wallet address controlling the token.
* **symbol:** The token’s symbol.

**Error Response:**

If the token ID is invalid or there’s a server error, you may receive a 500 status code with an error message.


```json
{
  "url": "/tokens/0x922A245e1164Bc4e9acB60741013c1FE0E975a9F1",
  "statusCode": 500,
  "statusMessage": "",
  "message": "Cast to ObjectId failed for value \"0x922A245e1164Bc4e9acB60741011013c1FE0E975a9F1\" (type string) at path \"_id\" for model \"Tokens\""
}
```

This error typically occurs if the ID format is incorrect or cannot be cast to an expected object type.

**Summary**

To retrieve a token by ID:

* Send a GET request to api.blls.me/billing/tokens/:id with the token’s unique ID.
* On success, you will receive the token’s details in JSON format.
* If an error occurs, you will receive a 500 error response explaining the issue.

This method lets you retrieve specific token information quickly and easily.
