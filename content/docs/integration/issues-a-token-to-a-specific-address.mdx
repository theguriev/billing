title: Issues a token to a specific Address
description: How to Make an Additional Issue to a Token
---

To increase the supply of a specific token, you can make an additional issuance by sending a POST request to the following API endpoint:

```bash
[POST] api.blls.me/billing/tokens/issue
```

### Request Body

The request body should contain the following fields:

```json
{
  "symbol": "string",      // Token symbol
  "address": "string",     // Wallet address controlling the token
  "emission": 10000000000, // Amount of additional tokens to issue
  "signature": "string"    // Signature for authorization
}
```

**Example Request:**

To issue an additional 10 billion tokens for a token with the symbol “MYTKN”, controlled by a wallet at 0x12345abcdef, your request body would look like this:

```json
{
  "symbol": "MYTKN",
  "address": "0x12345abcdef",
  "emission": 10000000000,
  "signature": "your-generated-signature"
}
```

### Signing Your Transaction

You need to include a signature in the request to verify that you are authorized to issue new tokens. The method for generating the signature is the same as described in the [Sign issue](/docs/utilities/sign-issue) guide. Use your private key and the ethers library (or an equivalent Ethereum-compatible tool) to generate the signature.

#### API Responses

**Success Response:**

If the issuance is successful, the server will return a 200 status code with details about the transaction:

```json
{
  "_id": "string",         // Unique transaction ID
  "from": "string",        // Issuing address
  "to": "string",          // Receiving address (typically the same as the issuing address)
  "symbol": "string",      // Token symbol
  "timestamp": "2024-10-15T18:59:48.527Z",  // Time of issuance
  "message": "string",     // Optional message
  "value": 0               // Value of the transaction
}
```

**Error Responses:**

* **400 Validation Error**: If there is an issue with the request data, you will receive a 400 status code with the following response:

```json
{
  "url": "/tokens/issue",
  "statusCode": 409,
  "statusMessage": "Validation Error",
  "message": "Validation Error"
}
```

* **404 Not Found:** If the token does not exist or there’s an issue with the token symbol or address, you will receive a 404 status code:

```json
{
  "message": "Token not found"
}
```

**Summary**

To make an additional issuance to a token:

* Send a POST request to api.blls.me/billing/tokens/issue.
* Include the symbol, address, emission, and a generated signature in the request body.
* Ensure that the request is properly signed using the private key for the wallet controlling the token.

By following these steps, you can increase the token supply as needed.
