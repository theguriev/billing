---

To retrieve all available transactions, you need to send a GET request to the following API endpoint:

```bash
[GET] api.blls.me/billing/transactions
```

### Search Request Parameters

When sending your request, you can include the following optional query parameters to filter and sort the transactions:

- **limit**: Maximum number of transactions to return. The default value is `10`.
- **offset**: The number of transactions to skip. The default value is `0`.
- **orderBy**: Field to sort the transactions by. The default is `timestamp`.
- **order**: Sort order for the transactions (either `asc` for ascending or `desc` for descending). 
- **symbol**: Filter transactions by token symbol.
- **address**: Filter transactions by a specific address (either `to` or `from`).

### Example Response

If the request is successful, the server will return a `200` status code along with the list of transactions in the following format:

```json
[
  {
    "_id": "string",
    "from": "string",       // Sender address
    "to": "string",         // Recipient address
    "symbol": "string",     // Token symbol
    "timestamp": "2024-10-16T17:38:42.166Z", // Time of transaction
    "message": "string",    // Optional message with the transaction
    "value": 0              // Value of the transaction
  }
]
```

**Summary**

1.	Send a GET request to api.blls.me/billing/transactions.
