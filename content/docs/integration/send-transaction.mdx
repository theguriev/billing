To send a transaction, you need to send a POST request to the following API endpoint:

```bash
[POST] api.blls.me/billing/transactions
```

### Request Body

The body of the request should contain the following fields:

```json
{
  "from": "string",     // Address from where the transaction is sent
  "to": "string",       // Address to where the transaction is sent
  "value": 1,           // Quantity of tokens to send
  "signature": "string",// Signature to verify the transaction
  "message": "string",  // Optional message with the transaction
  "symbol": "str"       // Token symbol
}
```

### Signing the Transaction

To send a valid transaction, you need to sign it using your private key. You can read about how to sign a transaction here. The signature ensures the transaction is authorized by the wallet owner.

You can read how to sign the transaction [here](/docs/utilities/sign-transaction)
