title: Safely Transfer Your Tokens
description: Learn how to safely send cryptocurrency tokens
---

Once you’ve created your cryptocurrency and built up your token supply, you’ll likely want to send some tokens to others. Our platform makes it easy to transfer funds, but there’s one important thing to keep in mind: **always double-check the recipient’s address**. Since blockchain transactions are irreversible, sending tokens to the wrong address means they cannot be recovered. Here’s how to send your funds safely.

### 1. Go to Your Wallet
First, navigate to your wallet page. This is where you can view your token balances and manage your transactions.

### 2. Click on the Send Button
Once you’re in your wallet, click the "Send" button to initiate a transaction.

### 3. Enter Transaction Details
You’ll need to provide a few key details for the transaction:
- **Token Symbol**: Select the token you want to send from the available list.
- **Amount**: Enter the number of tokens you wish to transfer.
- **Recipient Address**: Carefully input the wallet address of the recipient. **Double-check** this address to ensure it’s correct—once the transaction is sent, it can’t be undone.
- **Message (Optional)**: You can include a message with the transaction if needed.

### 4. Click Send
Once you’ve filled out all the details, click "Send." The platform will process the transaction, and the tokens will be transferred to the specified address.

### Important Reminder: Accuracy is Crucial
Remember, cryptocurrency transactions cannot be reversed. If you send tokens to the wrong address, there’s no way to retrieve them. Always verify the recipient’s wallet address carefully before sending funds.
