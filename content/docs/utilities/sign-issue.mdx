description: How to Create an Additional Issue with a Signed Transaction
---

To create an additional issue for your token, you will need to sign the transaction with your private key. This signature ensures that the issuance is authorized by the wallet owner. 

To simplify the process, we have created a simple function using the `ethers` library.

### Code Example for Signing an Additional Issue

Here is a function to help you sign the additional issue:

```typescript
import { Wallet } from 'ethers'

const signIssue = (privateKey: string, address: string, emission: number, symbol: string) => {
  const wallet = new Wallet(privateKey)
  return wallet.signMessage(JSON.stringify({ symbol, address, emission }))
}

export default signIssue

```

### Explanation:

* **privateKey**: Your private key, which authorizes the signing process.
* **address**: The wallet address that controls the token.
* **emission**: The amount of additional tokens you are issuing.
* **symbol**: The token symbol.

### Using the Ethers Library

In the example above, we used the ethers library to handle the signing process. However, you can use any other Ethereum-compatible library to generate the signature.

### Steps to Create an Additional Issue

1.	Install the ethers library using npm:
```bash
npm install ethers
```
2.	Use the signIssue function to generate the signature by passing your private key, wallet address, token emission amount, and token symbol.
3.	Once the signature is generated, you can include it in your API request to authorize the additional issue.

**Summary**

* Use your private key to sign the additional token issue.
* We provide a simple signing function using the ethers library, but you can choose any Ethereum-compatible tool.
* The signature ensures that the additional issuance is valid and authorized by the tokenâ€™s controlling wallet.
