To send a transaction from one wallet to another, you will need to sign the transaction using your private key. This ensures that the transaction is authorized by the sender's wallet.

To simplify the process, we have created a simple function using the `ethers` library.

### Code Example for Signing a Transaction

Here is a function to help you sign the transaction:

```typescript
import { Wallet } from 'ethers'

const signTransaction = (privateKey: string, from: string, to: string, value: number, symbol: string) => {
  const wallet = new Wallet(privateKey)
  return wallet.signMessage(JSON.stringify({ from, to, value, symbol }))
}

export default signTransaction
```

### Explanation:

* **privateKey**: The private key of the wallet from which you are sending the transaction.
* **from**: The address of the wallet sending the transaction.
* **to**: The address of the wallet receiving the transaction.
* **value**: The amount of tokens to send.
* **symbol**: The token symbol being transferred.

### Using the Ethers Library

In the example above, we used the ethers library to handle the signing process. However, you can use any other Ethereum-compatible library to generate the signature.

### Steps to Send a Transaction

1.	Install the ethers library using npm:
```bash
npm install ethers
```
2.	Use the signTransaction function to generate the signature by passing your private key, from and to wallet addresses, the transaction value, and the token symbol.
3.	Once the signature is generated, include it in your transaction API request to authorize the transfer of tokens.

**Summary**

* Use your private key to sign the transaction for wallet-to-wallet transfers.
* The signTransaction function provided here uses the ethers library, but you can use any other Ethereum-compatible tool.
* The signature ensures the transaction is valid and authorized by the senderâ€™s wallet.
